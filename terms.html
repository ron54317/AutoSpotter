            <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
            <p>AutoSpotterX is a mobile platform for car enthusiasts and spotters. Features include:</p>

                <li>Social features (friends, likes, reports, collections)</li>
                <li>AI-powered car detection & optional AI identification via Google Gemini API</li>
                <li>Private, location-based car mapping for personal reference</li>

                <li>Images are temporarily sent to Google for analysis (not permanently stored).</li>
