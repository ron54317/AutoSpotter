            <h2>AutoSpotterX – Terms of Service</h2>
            <p><em>Last Updated: July 10, 2025</em></p>

            <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
            <p>By downloading, installing, or using the AutoSpotterX application ("the App"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree, do not use the App. These Terms form a legally binding agreement between you and AutoSpotterX (Developer: Zarnox2525).</p>
            
            <p>Use of the App is also governed by our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>, which explains how we collect, use, and protect your data.</p>

            <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
            <p>AutoSpotterX is a mobile platform for car enthusiasts and spotters. Features include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Car spotting & photo sharing</li>
                <li>Car information database & rarity classification</li>
                <li>Personal car collection management</li>
                <li>Social features (friends, likes, reports, collections)</li>
                <li>AI-powered car detection & optional AI identification via Google Gemini API</li>
                <li>Private, location-based car mapping for personal reference</li>
                <li>Country-based browsing to explore car spots by region</li>
                <li>Secure photo storage & processing via Firebase and Cloudinary</li>
                <li>Automatic license plate & face blurring for privacy</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2.1 AI Identification</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Optional Google Gemini API processing (1 free use per account).</li>
                <li>Images are temporarily sent to Google for analysis (not permanently stored).</li>
                <li>Results include confidence scores but are not guaranteed to be accurate.</li>
                <li>Users must verify results; AutoSpotterX is not responsible for incorrect identifications.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. User Accounts</h2>
            <p>You must be at least 13 years old to create an account. Where local law requires a higher age (e.g. 16 in parts of Europe), that age applies.</p>
            
            <p>If you are under the minimum age in your country, you may only use the App with parental/guardian consent.</p>
            
            <p>You agree to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Provide accurate information when registering</li>
                <li>Keep your login credentials secure</li>
                <li>Be responsible for all activities under your account</li>
                <li>One account per user. Accounts are non-transferable.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. User Content</h2>
            <p>You retain ownership of your photos and content. However, by uploading, you grant AutoSpotterX and its third-party providers (Firebase, Cloudinary) a worldwide, non-exclusive license to store, process, and deliver your content for App functionality.</p>
            
            <h3>Content Rules</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Only upload photos you personally took of real vehicles.</li>
                <li>Do not upload images from Google, social media, or AI-generated content.</li>
                <li>Respect private property and personal privacy.</li>
                <li>No excessive editing or misleading modifications.</li>
                <li>No impersonation of AutoSpotterX, its staff, or other users.</li>
                <li>Do not falsely classify vehicles to manipulate rarity.</li>
                <li>Friends may see your collection & profile photo, but never your private location data.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Public Feed Rules</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Users with ≤3600 Auto XP can upload only RARE+ cars.</li>
                <li>Users with >3600 Auto XP can upload any car.</li>
                <li>Feed posts display: photo, vehicle details, caption, timestamp, city/country, and your profile info.</li>
                <li>GPS coordinates remain private.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Country Browsing Feature</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>AutoSpotterX includes a "Country Spots" feature that organizes car sightings by country.</li>
                <li>Users can browse car spots from specific countries (e.g., United Kingdom, United States, UAE, Germany, etc.).</li>
                <li>Each country section includes educational descriptions of local automotive culture and popular spotting locations (e.g., known streets, districts, or landmarks where exotic cars are commonly seen).</li>
                <li>Only cars not marked as "hidden from feed" during upload appear in country browsing.</li>
                <li>Country browsing follows the same rarity rules as the public feed: users with ≤3600 Auto XP can only share RARE+ cars, while users with >3600 Auto XP can share any vehicle.</li>
                <li>Country browsing displays car photos and make/model details only. Usernames and profile information are not shown in this view.</li>
                <li>Country-level location (e.g., "United States") is displayed, but precise GPS coordinates and street addresses remain private.</li>
                <li>An ISO country code (e.g., "US", "GB") is stored with each public spot to enable this feature.</li>
                <li>This feature is designed to help users discover automotive culture worldwide while maintaining privacy.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>5. Prohibited Conduct</h2>
            <p>You may not:</p>

                <li>Use the App for commercial purposes without approval</li>
                <li>Spam or abuse friend requests/messages</li>
