            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>This Privacy Policy explains how AutoSpotter ("we," "our," or "us") collects, uses, and protects your personal information when you use our mobile application. We are committed to protecting your privacy and handling your data transparently and securely. This policy applies to all users of the AutoSpotter app and covers data collected through our application.</p>

            <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
            <p><strong>Account & Profile Data:</strong> Email, username, name, encrypted password, and optional profile photo.</p>
            
            <p><strong>User Content:</strong> Vehicle photos, car collection data, specifications, friend connections, location data for car spottings, shared images, and optional car videos (stored locally only).</p>
            
            <p><strong>Device & Usage Data:</strong> Device model and OS version for app compatibility and functionality.</p>
            
            <p><strong>App Permissions:</strong> We request the following permissions to provide app functionality:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Camera:</strong> To take photos of vehicles (only accessed when you choose to take photos)</li>
                <li><strong>Storage:</strong> To save and manage your car photos and collection data</li>
                <li><strong>Location:</strong> For mapping features and associating location with car spots (only when you enable location features)</li>
                <li><strong>Internet:</strong> To sync data with Firebase services and provide online features</li>
                <li><strong>Network State:</strong> To determine connectivity and adjust app functionality accordingly</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>We use Firebase (Authentication, Cloud Storage, Firestore), Google ML Kit (license plate/face detection), TensorFlow Lite (on-device car detection), Google Gemini AI (AI car identification), and MapLibre GL (mapping). These services may collect device information and have their own privacy policies:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank">Firebase Privacy Policy</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google Privacy Policy</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/terms" target="_blank">Google Gemini API Terms</a></li>
                <li><strong>MapLibre GL:</strong> Open-source mapping library that processes data locally on your device with no data collection or external transmission</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3.1. AI Car Detection Service</h2>
            <p>AutoSpotter includes optional AI car identification using Google's Gemini API. When used, photos are temporarily processed by Google's servers (not permanently stored), with a 2-detection limit per user. Only car photos are transmitted - no personal data. This feature is completely optional.</p>

            <h2>4. How We Use Your Information</h2>
                         <p>We use your data to:</p>
             <ul>
                 <li>Manage your account and car collection</li>
                 <li>Process photos with AI detection and automatic privacy blurring</li>
                 <li>Provide AI-powered car identification through Google Gemini API (when you choose to use this feature)</li>
                 <li>Track AI detection usage to enforce the 1-detection limit per user</li>
                 <li>Enable social features and friend connections</li>
                 <li>Provide location-based mapping and car spotting features</li>
                 <li>Improve app functionality and fix issues</li>
                 <li>Send important app notifications</li>
                 <li>Analyze car data to maintain and improve our specifications database</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4.1. Car Specifications Database Management</h2>
            <p>We analyze car brand and model data from our database to identify vehicles that may need additional specifications. This helps us maintain accurate car information for all users. Only vehicle identification data (not personal information) is processed for database improvement purposes.</p>

            <h2>5. Data Security & Storage</h2>
            <p>Your data is stored on secure Firebase servers with encrypted transmission, secure authentication, and access controls. Passwords are hashed, never stored in plain text. Car detection and privacy blurring (license plates/faces) occur on your device, not our servers.</p>



            <h2>6. Data Sharing</h2>
            <p><strong>PERMANENT POLICY: AutoSpotter will NEVER sell your personal information to third parties.</strong> This is a core commitment that cannot be changed. Data is shared solely with trusted service providers to enable core app functionality, under strict confidentiality agreements and in accordance with applicable privacy laws. We only share data when:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Required by law</li>
                <li>With service providers (Firebase) under confidentiality agreements</li>
                <li>With friends you've connected with (car collection data only - friends can view your car collection but cannot see your car locations on the map)</li>
                <li>For administrative purposes (our admin can view all data for moderation and support)</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Important:</strong> Your car locations and map data are private - only you can see your cars on the map. However, friends you've connected with can still view your car collection details through the friends feature.</p>
             
             <h2>6.1. Map and Location Privacy</h2>
             <p>Our mapping system works as follows:</p>
             <ul>
                 <li><strong>Private Map Display:</strong> Only you can see your own cars on the map - other users (including friends) cannot see your car locations</li>
                 <li><strong>Location Accuracy:</strong> We collect precise GPS coordinates when you enable location for a car spotting</li>
                 <li><strong>Friends Access:</strong> While friends can view your car collection details, they cannot see the location data or view your cars on the map</li>
                 <li><strong>Privacy Controls:</strong> All location data is private by default - no other users can access your car locations</li>
                 <li><strong>Location Storage:</strong> GPS coordinates are securely stored in Firebase Firestore with strict access controls limiting visibility to you and our admin only</li>
                 <li><strong>Map Technology:</strong> We use MapLibre GL, an open-source mapping library that processes data locally on your device</li>
                 <li><strong>Data Removal:</strong> Deleting a car photo also removes its associated location data</li>
                 <li><strong>Content Moderation:</strong> Our admin can view and moderate car data for security and community standards, but regular users can only see their own data</li>
            </ul>

             <p><strong>âœ… Privacy Summary:</strong> Your map shows only your own cars. Friends can see your car collection details but NOT your car locations or map data.</p>

            <h2>7. Your Rights & Controls</h2>
            <p>You can:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Access and edit your profile data</li>
                <li>Delete individual photos or your entire account</li>
                <li>Export your car collection <em>or download a full machine-readable archive of your personal data</em></li>
                <li>Manage friend connections</li>
                <li>Control location sharing and app permissions</li>
                <li>Opt-out of non-essential communications</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>8. Account & Data Deletion</h2>
            <p><strong>Full Account Deletion:</strong> Use app settings or email zernoxi6@gmail.com. All personal data is deleted within 30 days.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Individual Content:</strong> Delete photos/entries anytime through the app. Removed within 24 hours.</p>
            
            <p><strong>What's Deleted:</strong> Profile info, photos, collection data, friend connections, location data, activity logs, and all locally stored videos.</p>

            <h2>9. Special Features</h2>
            <p><strong>Local AI Detection:</strong> Basic car detection and privacy blurring (license plates/faces) run locally on your device using TensorFlow Lite and Google ML Kit.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Local Video Storage:</strong> Optional car videos are stored locally on your device with AES-GCM encryption. Videos are never uploaded to our servers or shared with third parties. They remain private to your device and are automatically deleted when you remove the associated car entry or delete your account.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Cloud AI Identification:</strong> Optional car identification using Google's Gemini AI. Photos are sent to Google's API for analysis (not permanently stored), with 1 free use per user. Results include confidence scores - verify before relying on them.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Friends & Collection Sharing:</strong> Users can connect with friends to view each other's car collections. Friends can see your car details, photos, and collection information, but cannot see your car locations on the map or access your private location data.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Private Location & Mapping:</strong> Our interactive map displays only your own car spotting locations for personal reference. Precise location data is collected only when you choose to use mapping features and remains completely private to your account (plus admin access for moderation). Location information is associated with individual car photos when you enable it. Map data is processed locally on your device using MapLibre GL. All location data is private by default - no other users can see your car locations.</p>

            <h2>9.1. Photo Reporting System</h2>
            <p>Our app includes a photo reporting system that allows users to report inappropriate or concerning content:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Reporting Process:</strong> Users can report photos they believe violate our terms of service or community guidelines</li>
                <li><strong>Report Information:</strong> When you submit a report, we collect your user ID, the reported photo's details, and your reason for reporting</li>
                <li><strong>Admin Review:</strong> All reports are reviewed by administrators who may take action if necessary</li>
                <li><strong>Removal Criteria:</strong> Photos may be removed if they contain offensive or illegal content, infringe copyright, violate private property or personal privacy, or otherwise breach our Terms of Service or community guidelines</li>
                <li><strong>Possible Actions:</strong> Administrators may remove reported photos entirely or remove location data from photos</li>
                <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> If your photo is removed or modified due to a report, you will receive a notification in the app</li>
                <li><strong>Report Privacy:</strong> Your identity as a reporter is not shared with the photo owner</li>
                <li><strong>Data Retention:</strong> Report data is retained for moderation purposes and to maintain platform integrity</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>9.2. Photo Watermarking</h2>
            <p>AutoSpotter automatically adds a watermark to all photos processed through the app:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Watermark Content:</strong> All photos receive a subtle "AutoSpotter" watermark in the bottom-right corner</li>
                <li><strong>Processing:</strong> Watermarking is applied after privacy blurring but before saving or uploading</li>
                <li><strong>Local Processing:</strong> All watermarking occurs locally on your device</li>
                <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Watermarks help identify content from our app and protect intellectual property</li>
                <li><strong>Non-removable:</strong> Watermarks cannot be disabled and are a core feature of the app</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>10. Important Notes</h2>
            <p><strong>Children:</strong> We do not knowingly allow registration or use of AutoSpotter by children under the age of 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us at <a href="mailto:zernoxi6@gmail.com">zernoxi6@gmail.com</a> and we will promptly delete such information.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Data Retention:</strong> Data kept while account is active or as required by law. Deleted accounts are purged within 30 days.</p>
            
            <p><strong>AI Accuracy:</strong> AI features make best efforts but aren't 100% guaranteed. Users should verify before sharing.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Third-Party Data Processing:</strong> While we use Firebase services, most sensitive processing (basic car detection, privacy blurring, watermarking) occurs locally on your device for enhanced privacy. The optional AI car identification feature uses Google's Gemini API with secure transmission and no permanent storage.</p>
            
            <p><strong>AI Service Compliance:</strong> Our use of Google's Gemini API complies with Google's AI Principles and privacy policies. The service is designed to respect user privacy while providing accurate car identification.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Google Play Store:</strong> This app is distributed through the Google Play Store and complies with Google's privacy policies and developer terms.</p>
