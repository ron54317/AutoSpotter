            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>This Privacy Policy explains how AutoSpotter ("we," "our," or "us") collects, uses, and protects your personal information when you use our mobile application. We are committed to protecting your privacy and handling your data transparently and securely. This policy applies to all users of the AutoSpotter app and covers data collected through our application.</p>

            <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
            <p><strong>Account & Profile Data:</strong> Email, username, name, encrypted password, and optional profile photo.</p>
            
            <p><strong>User Content:</strong> Vehicle photos, car collection data, specifications, friend connections, location data for car spottings, shared images, and community verification data.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Device & Usage Data:</strong> (superseded by the following bullet)</p>
            
            <p><strong>Device, Usage & Diagnostics Data:</strong> Device model and OS version, anonymised App Instance ID, screen flow events, error logs, and crash diagnostics (stack traces) – <em>only</em> when you have enabled the "Analytics & Crash Reports" toggle.</p>
            
            <p><strong>App Permissions:</strong> We request the following permissions to provide app functionality:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Camera:</strong> To take photos of vehicles (only accessed when you choose to take photos)</li>
                <li><strong>Storage:</strong> To save and manage your car photos and collection data</li>
                <li><strong>Location:</strong> For mapping features and associating location with car spots (only when you enable location features)</li>
                <li><strong>Internet:</strong> To sync data with Firebase services and provide online features</li>
                <li><strong>Network State:</strong> To determine connectivity and adjust app functionality accordingly</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>We use Firebase (Authentication, Cloud Storage, Firestore), Google ML Kit (license plate/face detection), TensorFlow Lite (on-device car detection), and MapLibre GL (mapping). Firebase Analytics is only enabled with your explicit consent and can be disabled at any time in Settings. These services may collect device information and have their own privacy policies:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank">Firebase Privacy Policy</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy#crashlytics" target="_blank">Firebase Crashlytics Privacy Terms</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google Privacy Policy</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://maplibre.org/privacy-policy/" target="_blank">MapLibre Privacy Policy</a></li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. How We Use Your Information</h2>
                         <p>We use your data to:</p>
             <ul>
                 <li>Manage your account and car collection</li>
                 <li>Process photos with AI detection and automatic privacy blurring</li>
                 <li>Enable social features and friend connections</li>
                 <li>Provide location-based mapping and car spotting features</li>
                 <li>Enable community verification features</li>
                 <li>Improve app functionality and fix issues</li>
                 <li>Send important app notifications</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>5. Data Security & Storage</h2>
            <p>Your data is stored on secure Firebase servers with encrypted transmission, secure authentication, and access controls. Passwords are hashed, never stored in plain text. Car detection and privacy blurring (license plates/faces) occur on your device, not our servers.</p>

            <h2>5.1. Analytics & Crash Reports Consent</h2>
            <p>We only collect anonymised analytics events (Firebase Analytics) and crash diagnostics (Firebase Crashlytics) after <em>you</em> have enabled the "Analytics & Crash Reports" switch found in the in-app Settings or on first-run consent screen.  When the switch is off, both services remain completely disabled and no data leaves your device.  You may toggle this preference at any time and the change takes immediate effect.  Turning the switch off also honours California's "Do Not Sell or Share" right under the CPRA.</p>

            <p>The analytics data includes a random App Instance ID, generic device/OS model, screen flows and anonymised event counts.  Crash reports include a stack-trace, device model/OS version and the last used screen name; they <strong>never</strong> contain photo binaries, precise location, e-mail address or any text you typed.</p>

            <p>You can delete previously collected analytics/crash data by deleting your account or by e-mailing us with the subject line "Analytics Deletion Request".</p>

            <h2>6. Data Sharing</h2>
            <p>We do <em>not</em> sell your personal data to third parties. Data is shared solely with trusted service providers to enable core app functionality, under strict confidentiality agreements and in accordance with applicable privacy laws. We only share data when:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Required by law</li>
                <li>With service providers (Firebase) under confidentiality agreements</li>
                <li>With friends you've connected with (car collection data only)</li>
                <li>For public map features (when you add location to photos)</li>
            </ul>
                         <p><strong>Important:</strong> Photos with location data appear on the public map visible to all users.</p>
             
             <h2>6.1. Map and Location Details</h2>
             <p>Our mapping system works as follows:</p>
             <ul>
                 <li><strong>Public Map Display:</strong> When you add location data to a car photo, it becomes visible on the public map that all app users can see</li>
                 <li><strong>Location Accuracy:</strong> We collect precise GPS coordinates when you enable location for a car spotting</li>
                 <li><strong>Community Interaction:</strong> Other users can view, verify, and interact with your location-tagged car spots</li>
                 <li><strong>Privacy Controls:</strong> You can choose to save car photos without location data to keep them private from the public map</li>
                 <li><strong>Location Sharing:</strong> Each photo upload gives you the option to include or exclude location data</li>
                 <li><strong>Map Technology:</strong> We use MapLibre GL, an open-source mapping library that processes data locally on your device</li>
                 <li><strong>Location Storage:</strong> GPS coordinates are securely stored in Firebase Firestore with restricted access controls</li>
                 <li><strong>Data Removal:</strong> Deleting a car photo also removes its associated location data from the map</li>
                 <li><strong>Content Moderation:</strong> We reserve the right to remove inappropriate photos or car entries from the public map to maintain community standards and app security</li>
            </ul>

             <p><strong>⚠️ Important Warning:</strong> Any car photo you add with location data will be publicly visible to ALL app users on the map. Only add location data if you're comfortable with public visibility of that car spotting.</p>

            <h2>7. Your Rights & Controls</h2>
            <p>You can:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Access and edit your profile data</li>
                <li>Delete individual photos or your entire account</li>
                <li>Export your car collection <em>or download a full machine-readable archive of your personal data</em></li>
                <li>Manage friend connections</li>
                <li>Control location sharing and app permissions</li>
                <li>Opt-out of non-essential communications</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>8. Account & Data Deletion</h2>
            <p><strong>Full Account Deletion:</strong> Use app settings or email zernoxi6@gmail.com. All personal data is deleted within 30 days.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Individual Content:</strong> Delete photos/entries anytime through the app. Removed within 24 hours.</p>
            
            <p><strong>What's Deleted:</strong> Profile info, photos, collection data, friend connections, location data, and activity logs. Some anonymized data may be retained for analytics.</p>

            <h2>9. Special Features</h2>
            <p><strong>AI Detection:</strong> Car detection and privacy blurring (license plates/faces) run locally on your device.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Community Features:</strong> Users can verify car spot locations. Verification data is anonymized and helps improve spot accuracy.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Location & Mapping:</strong> Our interactive map displays car spotting locations and allows you to explore the automotive community. Precise location data is collected only when you choose to use mapping features. Location information is associated with individual car photos when you enable it. Map data is processed locally on your device using MapLibre GL. All location sharing is under your control - you can choose to share car photos with or without location data for each individual photo.</p>

            <h2>9.1. Photo Reporting System</h2>
            <p>Our app includes a photo reporting system that allows users to report inappropriate or concerning content:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Reporting Process:</strong> Users can report photos they believe violate our terms of service or community guidelines</li>
                <li><strong>Report Information:</strong> When you submit a report, we collect your user ID, the reported photo's details, and your reason for reporting</li>
                <li><strong>Admin Review:</strong> All reports are reviewed by administrators who may take action if necessary</li>
                <li><strong>Removal Criteria:</strong> Photos may be removed if they contain offensive or illegal content, infringe copyright, violate private property or personal privacy, or otherwise breach our Terms of Service or community guidelines</li>
                <li><strong>Possible Actions:</strong> Administrators may remove reported photos entirely or remove location data from photos</li>
                <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> If your photo is removed or modified due to a report, you will receive a notification in the app</li>
                <li><strong>Report Privacy:</strong> Your identity as a reporter is not shared with the photo owner</li>
                <li><strong>Data Retention:</strong> Report data is retained for moderation purposes and to maintain platform integrity</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>9.2. Photo Watermarking</h2>
            <p>AutoSpotter automatically adds a watermark to all photos processed through the app:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Watermark Content:</strong> All photos receive a subtle "AutoSpotter" watermark in the bottom-right corner</li>
                <li><strong>Processing:</strong> Watermarking is applied after privacy blurring but before saving or uploading</li>
                <li><strong>Local Processing:</strong> All watermarking occurs locally on your device</li>
                <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Watermarks help identify content from our app and protect intellectual property</li>
                <li><strong>Non-removable:</strong> Watermarks cannot be disabled and are a core feature of the app</li>
            </ul>
