            <h2>10. AI Features and Privacy</h2>
            <p>10.1. Car Detection:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Our app uses TensorFlow Lite for on-device car detection</li>
                <li>This technology helps verify if photos contain vehicles</li>
                <li>All car detection processing happens locally on your device</li>
                <li>Free accounts can access car detection for all photos</li>
                <li>No images are sent to external servers for car detection</li>
            </ul>

            <p>10.2. AI Accuracy Disclaimer:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Our car detection system makes best efforts to identify vehicles correctly but is not guaranteed to be 100% accurate</li>
                <li>Users should verify all AI-generated information before relying on it</li>
                <li>The AI system does not learn from or adapt based on user data</li>
                <li>AI processing uses on-device (TensorFlow Lite) technology</li>
            </ul>

            <p>10.3. Privacy Protection in Images:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The app automatically detects and blurs license plates in all vehicle photos using Google ML Kit</li>
                <li>The app automatically detects and blurs faces that may appear in vehicle photos using Google ML Kit</li>
                <li>All license plate and face detection/blurring occurs entirely on your device</li>
                <li>No unblurred images containing license plates or faces are stored or transmitted</li>
                <li>These privacy protections apply to both photos taken within the app and images shared from other applications</li>
                <li>While we make best efforts to detect and blur all sensitive information, the system is not guaranteed to be 100% effective, and users should verify photos before sharing</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>11. Social Features and Friend Connections</h2>
            <p>Our app includes social features that allow you to:</p>

                <li>Send and receive friend requests</li>
                <li>View friends' car collections</li>
                <li>Share your car collection with friends</li>
                <li>Search for friends within the app</li>
            </ul>
            <p>When you connect with another user as a friend, they will be able to see all cars in your collection. Your email and profile photo will be visible to users you connect with. Friend connections are stored in our Firebase Firestore database and are only visible to the connected users.</p>

            <h2>12. Location Data and Mapping</h2>
            <p>When you enable location features:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>We collect your precise location only when you use map-related features</li>
                <li>Location data may be associated with car spottings you upload</li>
                <li>Map data is processed using MapLibre GL, an open-source mapping library</li>
                <li>All map rendering happens locally on your device</li>
                <li>No third-party map providers receive your personal information</li>
                <li>You can disable location permissions at any time through your device settings</li>
                <li>Location history is stored securely and accessible only to you and those you explicitly share with</li>
                <li>The map displays car spots from your collection and those shared by your friends</li>
                <li>You can filter map displays to show only your cars or recent spots</li>
                <li><strong>Important:</strong> When you add location data to a car photo, that photo will be visible to all users on the public map. This means anyone using the app can see your car spotting at that location. Please be mindful of this when sharing location data.</li>
                <li>You can choose to share car photos without location data to maintain privacy</li>
                <li>Location data is only shared when you explicitly enable it for a specific car spotting</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>13. Image Sharing Features</h2>
            <p>Our app can receive images shared from other applications:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>When you share images from your gallery or other apps to CarSpotter, we process these images to add them to your collection</li>
                <li>Shared images are processed for car detection and privacy protection (license plate and face blurring)</li>
                <li>Shared images are stored securely using the same protections as photos taken within the app</li>
                <li>Metadata from shared images (such as location or timestamps) may be processed if available</li>
                <li>You maintain control over images shared to the app and can delete them at any time</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>14. Changes to This Policy</h2>
