            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>AutoSpotterX ("we," "our," or "us") values your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use the AutoSpotterX mobile app (available on Google Play). It applies to all users of the app and covers the data collected through the app.</p>

            <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
            <p>We collect the following types of information:</p>

                <li><strong>Like Notifications:</strong> When you like someone's car, the person who spotted the car will receive a notification showing that you liked their car (e.g., "John liked your Ferrari F40"). The notification includes your display name (first name, last name, or username) and car details. Your user ID is used internally for app functionality but is not displayed in the UI.</li>
                <li><strong>Friend Requests:</strong> When you send a friend request to someone (including through the feed and leaderboard), the recipient can see your display name and profile photo in the Friends screen where they can accept or reject the request. They will also receive a notification (e.g., "John sent you a friend request"). Your user ID is used internally for app functionality but is not displayed in the UI. No other personal data is shared.</li>
                <li><strong>Administrators:</strong> Can access user data (photos, profile information, content) for moderation/support. Administrators can delete car photos/spots that do not comply with our Terms of Service. When administrators delete content, it is permanently removed from our servers (Firestore and Cloudinary).

            </ul>

            <h2>6.1 Map and Location Privacy</h2>
            <p>AutoSpotterX's mapping features handle location data with maximum privacy protection:</p>
            
            <div style="border: 2px solid #FF9800; background-color: #FFF3E0; padding: 15px; border-radius: 8px; margin: 15px 0;">
                <p style="margin: 0; color: #333; font-size: 14px;">
                    <strong style="color: #E65100;">📍 Location Privacy Update:</strong> As of November 27, 2025, GPS coordinates are stored exclusively on your device and never uploaded to our servers. Earlier app versions uploaded location data to Firebase. Legacy location data is automatically deleted when you update or delete a car. Contact us at <a href="mailto:zernoxi6@gmail.com">zernoxi6@gmail.com</a> to request immediate deletion of any remaining legacy data.
                </p>
            </div>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Private Map Display:</strong> Only you can see the exact locations of your own car spottings. Other users, including friends, cannot view your car locations.</li>
                <li><strong>Location Storage:</strong> GPS coordinates are stored exclusively on your device in app-private storage (protected by Android file system permissions, not encrypted). Never uploaded to Firebase or external servers.</li>
                <li><strong>Country Information:</strong> To enable country-based features, we derive country name/code from coordinates using Google's geocoding service (coordinates sent temporarily for lookup per Google's Privacy Policy). Only country info is stored in our database—exact coordinates are not.</li>
                <li><strong>Friends Access:</strong> Friends can see your car details but cannot see location information or map markers.</li>
                <li><strong>Mapping Technology:</strong> MapTiler provides map tiles only (no access to your coordinates). MapLibre GL renders maps on your device.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Removal:</strong> Deleting a car entry permanently removes location data from your device and any legacy data from Firebase.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Privacy Summary:</strong> Your exact car locations are stored only on your device and are completely private. Only you can see your location data. Friends can view your car collection but cannot see location information.</p>

            <h2>6.2 Content Licensing and Promotion</h2>
            <p>By sharing content in the App, you grant AutoSpotterX a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use, reproduce, display, and distribute your content (including photos, captions, and vehicle information) for promotional and marketing purposes, including but not limited to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Social media promotion (e.g., Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, TikTok, YouTube)</li>
                <li>Marketing materials and advertisements</li>
                <li>App store listings and promotional screenshots</li>
                <li>Press releases and media coverage</li>
                <li>Website and blog content</li>
                <li>Other promotional activities to promote the App and its features</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This license applies to content you share publicly in the App (such as posts in the public feed). When we use your content for promotional purposes, we will credit you by your display name or username when feasible and appropriate. If you do not wish your content to be used for promotional purposes, you can disable sharing to the public feed in your privacy settings.</p>
            <p>This license is limited to uses necessary to operate, improve, and promote AutoSpotterX, and does not transfer ownership of the content to AutoSpotterX.</p>

            <h2>7. Your Rights and Controls</h2>
            <p>You have control over your personal data and account. You can view and update your profile information, delete your photos or entries, request data export, manage friends, control app permissions through device settings, and opt out of non-essential communications.</p>

            <h2>8. Account and Data Deletion</h2>
            <p>You can delete your entire account in app settings or by emailing us at zernoxi6@gmail.com (subject: "Account Deletion"). All personal data will be permanently deleted within 30 days. Deleting individual photos or entries removes that content from our servers within 24 hours. Deletion covers all personal data including profile info, photos, videos, car collection details, friend connections, and activity logs.</p>
            <p><strong>Administrative Deletion:</strong> Content may also be deleted by administrators if it violates our Terms of Service. When administrators delete your content for policy violations, it is permanently removed from our servers (Firestore and Cloudinary). You will be notified via in-app notification if your content is deleted for policy violations.</p>

            <h2>9. Additional (Optional) Features</h2>
            <p>AutoSpotterX offers several optional features with extra privacy considerations:</p>

            <p><strong>On-Device AI Detection:</strong> The app includes basic car detection and privacy blurring (for license plates and faces) using Google ML Kit on your device. All processing occurs locally, and original images remain on your device. We do not send your photos to external servers for this feature.</p>

            <p><strong>Local Video Storage:</strong> If you record car videos within the app, they are stored only on your device in encrypted form (using AES-GCM). These videos are never uploaded or shared externally. Deleting the associated car entry or your account will erase these videos.</p>

            <p><strong>Cloud AI Identification:</strong> As mentioned in Section 3.1, the optional Google Gemini service can analyze car photos. This is an opt-in feature: you must choose to send a photo to Google for identification. Only the image is sent (no personal data), and it is not stored permanently.</p>

            <p><strong>Friends & Collection Sharing:</strong> If you connect with other users, you can view each other's car collections and profile photos in the app. Friends cannot see your precise car locations or any additional personal data beyond what you've shared (such as display name and avatar). See Section 6.1 for location privacy details.</p>

            <p><strong>Public Spot Feed:</strong> (See Section 9.3 below.)</p>

            <h2>9.1 Photo Reporting System</h2>
            <p>Users can report photos that violate our Terms of Service. When you report content, we collect your user ID, the reported content's ID, and the reason. Our admin team reviews reports and takes appropriate action. When content is reported and found to violate our Terms of Service, it will be deleted from the app and our servers (Firestore and Cloudinary). Users whose content is deleted will be notified via in-app notification. Content may be deleted immediately upon review if it violates our policies. Your identity as the reporter is kept confidential. Report records are kept for moderation purposes only.</p>

            <h2>9.2 Photo Watermarking</h2>
            <p>All photos are automatically watermarked with "AutoSpotterX" for branding and content protection. Watermarking is done locally on your device and cannot be disabled.</p>

            <h2>9.3 Public Spot Feed</h2>
            <p>The Spot Feed is a community feature where users can share and browse car sightings. Feed posts show your car photo, make/model, like count, country name, and your display name/profile photo. Only country name is displayed—exact location data is never uploaded (see Section 6.1). Other users can like or report posts. You can disable feed sharing at any time in Settings → Privacy. Posting to the Feed is optional.</p>

            <h2>9.4 Country Browsing Feature</h2>
            <p>AutoSpotterX includes a "Country Spots" feature that allows users to browse car sightings organized by country. This feature shows only country-level location data—no precise GPS coordinates or street addresses (see Section 6.1). Users can see car photos and make/model details, but usernames and profile information are not displayed. Only cars not hidden from the feed appear in country browsing. Country codes are derived from coordinates and stored, but exact coordinates remain on your device.</p>

            <h2>10. Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>We do not knowingly collect information from or allow registration of children under 13 years of age. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with personal data, please contact us at zernoxi6@gmail.com. We will promptly delete any such information from our servers.</p>

            <h2>11. Other Important Notes</h2>
            <p><strong>Data Retention:</strong> We retain your personal data only as long as necessary to provide the app services or as required by law. When you delete your account, we will remove your data from our systems within 30 days, except for any data we are legally required to keep (such as anonymized logs).</p>

            <p><strong>AI Accuracy:</strong> Our AI features (car detection, identification) are designed to assist you, but they are not 100% accurate. Results should be treated as probabilistic; always verify important information manually.</p>

            <p><strong>Local vs. Cloud Processing:</strong> Most sensitive processing (e.g., blurring, watermarking) happens on your device. Third-party servers (e.g., Google/Cloud services) are only used for authentication, data storage, and optional AI identification if you opt in.</p>

            <p><strong>App Distribution:</strong> AutoSpotterX is distributed through the Google Play Store. We adhere to Google's developer policies and privacy guidelines.</p>

            <h2>12. Data Protection and International Transfers</h2>
            <p><strong>Data Protection:</strong> We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your data against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. This includes using encryption, secure authentication, and access controls.</p>

            <p><strong>International Transfers:</strong> Your data may be processed in countries other than your own (for example, on servers operated by Google or other service providers worldwide). In such cases, we ensure appropriate safeguards (such as compliance with EU Standard Contractual Clauses or similar measures) are in place to protect your data.</p>

            <p><strong>Legal Basis:</strong> If you are an EU resident (GDPR), we rely on the following legal grounds for processing:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Consent:</strong> When you give explicit permission (e.g., enabling location services).</li>
                <li><strong>Contract Performance:</strong> To perform the services you request (e.g., providing access to your account and collection).</li>
                <li><strong>Legitimate Interests:</strong> For app functionality, security, and improvement, balancing our interests against your privacy rights.</li>
                <li><strong>Legal Compliance:</strong> To comply with laws and regulatory obligations.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>13. GDPR and CCPA Rights</h2>
            <p>We comply with applicable privacy laws, including the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA):</p>

            <p><strong>EU (GDPR) Rights:</strong> If you reside in the European Economic Area, you have rights under GDPR, including the right to access, correct, or delete your personal data; the right to restrict or object to certain processing; the right to data portability; and the right to withdraw consent at any time. You may also lodge a complaint with a data protection authority. To exercise these rights, please contact us (see below).</p>

            <p><strong>California (CCPA) Rights:</strong> California residents have the right to know what personal data is collected and how it is used, the right to request deletion of personal data, and the right to opt out of the sale of personal data. AutoSpotterX does not sell your personal information (ever) – this is a permanent, unchangeable policy. If you wish to request deletion or disclosure of your data, please contact us.</p>
